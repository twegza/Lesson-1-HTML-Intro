Lesson one I just did!

In this lesson I took basics of HTML:

1. DOCTYPE: this line is writen at the beginning of any HTML webpage, it is needed for the browser to know which HTML version is been used here.

2. HEAD: is used for METATAGS, title, and more.

3. BODY: is used for filling it with the webpage content (Headers, Paragraphs, Videos, etc.).
