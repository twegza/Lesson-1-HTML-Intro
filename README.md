# lesson1
Lesson one I just did!

In this lesson I took basics of HTML:

1. DOCTYPE: this line is writen at the beginning of any HTML webpage, it is needed for the browser to know which HTML version is been used here.

2. HEAD: is used for METATAGS, title, and more.

3. BODY: is used for filling it with the webpage content (Headers, Paragraphs, Videos, etc.).

Front-End and Back-End: Front-End and Back-End have got the structure of any website, let's start by the front-end which the page you see in front of you on a screen from logos, menus, icons, videos, and much more, these types of websites with only front-end called STATIC websites. To add more functionality for the website we have to add and deal with the Back-End, which adds more functionality to the website, by handling data, and store it, handle request from and to the server and much more, also it handles databases (MongoDB, MySQL, and Firebase).
